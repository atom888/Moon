<center>A little about me.</center>

Hello! I am Adam Dipinto and this is my small corner of the internet.

I am passionate about building things for the [web](https://atom888.github.io/projects/), learning new technologies and having some fun along the way! Currently I devote most of my time to frontend side of things, but I am not afraid to dig into backend or any other tech to get the job done.

I consider myself a life long learner because I don't know a whole lot, but that's not a bad thing because I find it keeps me curious and allows me to try and look at things with a different perspective.

 This website contains my journey on the web in the form of my [projects]((https://atom888.github.io/projects/)), and [blog](https://atom888.github.io/posts/).
