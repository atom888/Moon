This is the second or third version of my personal website. The previous versions were just attempts and mainly used as learning experiences. This latest version, I wanted to challenge myself and learn the full process behind building a website. To go through the creative proceedings required for creating and filtering ideas designing wireframes and mockups, solidifying those ideas with code, and lastly deploying the final state.

I don’t intend to make this a lengthy post but I wanted to share why this website exists. This website will take up it’s only little corner of the internet to provide simple insight into the development process of creating web application while allowing for myself to deconstruct the projects and learn how to improve for the next.

Here are a few things I did for this website:

* Reviewed website from creators I’m inspired by
* Made a list of helpful resources for self-study
* Learned how to host a project using Firebase
* Purchased a personal domain name
* Setup this Jekyll site from scratch
